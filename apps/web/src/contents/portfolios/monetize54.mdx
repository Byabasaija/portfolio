## About

Digital creators and nomads in Africa, or those targeting an African audience, often struggle to monetize their skills, platforms, or digital spaces. This is due to limited access to payment solutions, lack of visibility, and marketplaces that do not cater to the unique realities of the African digital economy.

Monetize54 was born out of this need, a marketplace tailored for African digital services. It supports local payments, enables service listings with clear pricing, and includes features like reviews, chat, and dispute resolution to build trust.
Built with Python framework FastAPI on the backend with MongoDB and JavaScript framework Nextjs on the frontend with tailwind styling.

Though still in its early stages,monetize54 has started gaining traction in most African countries like Nigeria and Kenya.
