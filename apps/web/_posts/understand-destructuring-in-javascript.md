### Introduction

Came across a destructured array and couldn't figure out what is going on?  
Relax — you're not alone. I too was in the same situation sometime back, and I’m here to help you get comfortable with the concept. Gerrit?

Ready to dive? Let's do it.

### What is Destructuring?

Destructuring means breaking down a structured data type (like arrays or objects) into individual parts.

Before ES6, accessing values from arrays or objects involved a bit of boilerplate:

```ts
const movies = ["spiderman", "red", "FF9"]
const mostLoved = movies[0]
console.log(mostLoved) // "spiderman"
```
Too much hustle, right?

Let’s make that neater with destructuring:
```ts
const [mostLoved] = ["spiderman", "red", "FF9"]
console.log(mostLoved) // "spiderman"
```
That’s it!

### Why Use Destructuring?
Destructuring allows us to extract array values or object properties into variables using just one statement.

***Arrays Example:***
```ts
const [a, b, c] = ["x", "y", "z"]
console.log(a, b, c) // "x" "y" "z"
```
***Objects Example:***
```ts
const person = { name: "John", age: 30 }
const { name, age } = person
console.log(name, age) // "John" 30
```
It’s clean, readable, and modern.

### Wrap-up
Destructuring simplifies your code by reducing repetition and making intent clearer. Whether you're working with arrays, objects, or function parameters — it's a game-changer.
