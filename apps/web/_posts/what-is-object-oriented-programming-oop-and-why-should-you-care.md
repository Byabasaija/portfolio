### What is Object-Oriented Programming that every programmer talks about?

Why do they care about it anyway? Let’s open our minds.

So you’ve heard many software engineers talk about OOP—maybe your tutor, or perhaps you’ve come across articles written about it but still can’t connect the dots… Just keep reading, you won’t regret it. I promise.

In this article, we’re going to focus on **understanding**, not just definitions.  
If you want a more formal definition, you can check it out [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming).

---

### Understanding…

When I was learning the English language, I was told that in order to understand a sentence and its full meaning, I needed to:

- Break it down  
- Pick out the main words  
- Look them up in the dictionary  
- Find the contextual meaning  
- Rebuild the sentence  

That’s how I learned English, and I’ve used that technique my entire life to learn new concepts.

_(…ssh! that’s a little bit of a secret!)_

So how do we apply this to OOP?  
Just read on...

### What is OOP, really?

**Object-Oriented**, as it sounds, organizes software design around **objects**.  
Objects in programming are known to be data fields that have **unique attributes and behavior**.

In OOP, we focus on the **objects** we want to manipulate **first**, then build the logic to manipulate them.

#### A Real-Life Analogy

Say you want to build a house.

You don’t just start buying materials. First, you make a **plan**:

- What features does your house need?
- How many rooms?
- Electricity?
- Water?

**That’s OOP thinking.**  
Define the objects (house, rooms, power), and then build the logic.

---

### The Structure of OOP

Let’s continue with our **house** analogy.

#### 🏗️ Classes

At the very top level of an OOP program, we have a **class**.

You can’t build partitions/rooms without building the main walls, right?

A **class** acts as a **blueprint** for:

- Individual objects
- Attributes
- Methods

---

#### 🧱 Objects

Now it’s time to talk about **rooms** in the house.

These are **instances** of our main building (the class).

In programming terms:

> An **object** is an instance of a class.

---

#### 🔌 Methods

Your house might need some additional things to be perfectly habitable:

- Electric power
- Water

In programming, these are like **functions**—they describe the **behavior** of your objects.

So if a room needs light, it must be connected to power.  
The **method** is that connection.

---

#### 💡 Attributes

We’ve got the main building, the rooms, and the power.

Now, how do we light up a room?

We need **lamps**.

Let those be our **attributes**.  
They represent the **state** of our objects.  
Objects store data in these attribute fields.

---

### Recap

The structure is simple:

- **Classes** are the blueprint  
- **Objects** are instances  
- **Methods** define behavior  
- **Attributes** store data/state  

All things are connected, and methods or attributes are just a **call away**.

---

### What if you forgot something?

What if there's something we need in our house but forgot to include in the plan?

Do we destroy everything and rebuild?  
**NO.**

You heard me.

#### So what do we do?

**Go borrow from the neighbour who has.**

How?

That’s what we’ll explore in the **next article**...

### Bye for now and thanks for reading

**Happy coding!**
